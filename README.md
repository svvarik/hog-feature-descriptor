# Histogram of Gradient Feature Descriptor

This was an assignment to implement a Histogram of Gradient feature descriptor. I used six bins as specified in the assignment. 

I used a sample image of my desk with flash on, and visualized the HOG descriptor using both magnitude and occurence for the histogram values.

It can be observed the feature descriptor was somewhat effective in locating features in the image, such as the sanitizer bottle or the monitor arm. Unfortunately, due to the image / screem resolution, you might have to zoom in to see the feature detection.
